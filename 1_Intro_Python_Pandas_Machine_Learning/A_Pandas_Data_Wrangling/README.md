   <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
  </summary>

  This lab allows you to practice and apply the concepts and techniques taught in class. 

  Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:
  
- Create Pandas DataFrames from CSV files.
- Explore Pandas DataFrames to get the number of rows, columns, summary statistics and data types.
- Manipulate Series objects using various methods, including sort_values or value_counts.
- Access data in DataFrames through columns (as a dictionary or attribute) and by using loc or iloc to access rows.
- Filter and select data in DataFrames using simple comparison and logical operators

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pandas Lab! In this lab, you will learn how to work with and create pandas series and dataframes. These are powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis in Python and allow you to create, manipulate, and analyze large, complex datasets with ease, making it a valuable library for any data scientist or analyst.

You will also learn how to access their attributes and values, and manipulate them using a variety of built-in methods as well as learn how to filter and sort data and summarize and describe data. By the end of this lab, you will have a strong foundation in working with pandas series and dataframes, which you can apply to real-world data analysis problems.

## About the dataset

### Context
The dataset comprises customer data related to their vehicle insurance policies. It provides details about both the customers and the specific insurance coverage they've opted for. This data an be explored to segment similar kinds of customers.

### Content
This dataset provides socio-economic information of customers alongside details of their insured vehicles.  The data contains both categorical and numerical variables. The "Customer Lifetime Value" (CLV) has also been provided, which is derived from historical data. This is essential in understanding the customer purchase behavior.

### Inspiration
The data is useful for clustering customers according to their behavior, thereby enabling targeted marketing of a new insurance policy. This helps pre-estimating a budget for marketing expenses.
