## Introduction

Welcome to our data cleaning and formatting lab! In this lab, we will focus on the essential skills required to clean and format data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and usable.

Data cleaning is a critical step in the data analysis process. It involves identifying and resolving errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in datasets, which may arise from different data sources. Data formatting, on the other hand, involves transforming raw data into a proper format that can be easily analyzed.

By the end of this lab, you will have gained the knowledge and skills to confidently clean and format your data, enabling you to perform effective data analysis and produce high-quality reports.
