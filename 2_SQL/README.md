<summary>
  <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
</summary>

  This lab allows you to practice and apply the concepts and techniques taught in class. 

  Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:
  
- Use SQL queries to extract insights from the data and answer research questions or problem statements, using techniques such as selecting columns with SELECT clause, filtering with WHERE clause, sorting data with ORDER BY clause, limiting results with LIMIT, using DISTINCT to retrieve unique values, and counting records with COUNT.

## Introduction

Welcome to the SQL Basic Queries lab!

In this lab, you will practice how to use SQL queries to extract insights from the  [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database which contains information about movie rentals. 

In this lab, you'll practice the basics of SQL, including how to select data from tables, filter results using the WHERE clause, aggregate data with functions like COUNT, and sort results using the ORDER BY clause. 

Throughout the lab, you will work with two SQL query files: `sakila-schema.sql`, which creates the database schema, and `sakila-data.sql`, which inserts the data into the database. You can download the necessary files locally by following the steps listed in [Sakila sample database - installation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html). 

You can also refer to the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the database to guide your analysis:
