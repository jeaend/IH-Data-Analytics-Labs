# Lab | Random variable distributions

Refer to the `numerical.csv` dataset that you previously saved.

### Instructions

1. Use the numerical variables from our dataset this week.
2. Check using a distribution plot if the variables fit the theoretical normal or exponential distribution.
3. Check if any of the transformations (log-transform, etc.) we have seen up to this point changes the result.
